# Overview

The Pantry Planner helps with meal planning by finding recipies with ingredients you already have.<br>
Page 1 (use_pantry_items) accepts a list of recipe ingredients, searches a database for those ingredients, and provides links/images for those recipes.<br>
Page 2 (find_forgotten_recipe) accepts a list of ingredients like page 1, but also accepts the name of a recipe. It then responds with recipes that match the recipe name, along with ingredients not given as parameters.
